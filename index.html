      <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
      <p>I'm studying WEB 168 to broaden my understanding of web programming. This course is required for my degree because I am majoring in web development. I wanted to learn more about the WEB 152 course I took earlier. I am just beginning right
        now,
        therefore by the end of this course, I hope to have more experience and a strong portfolio to get internships.</p>

      <h2>What hobbies do you enjoy doing in your free time?</h2>
      <p>During my free time, I enjoy doing a lot of things. I mostly love spending time with friends and family. That can be going for a walk, hiking, shopping and a lot more. I also love reading books and watching movies. These days I have been
        trying
        to learn a new skill like cooking in my free time instead of just having fun. I try to have one task in my free time that makes me improve my skills.
